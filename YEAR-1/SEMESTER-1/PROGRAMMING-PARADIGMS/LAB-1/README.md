# Lab 1: Introduction to Mozart/Oz

### Exercise 1: Absolute Value  
Write a function `Abs` that computes the absolute value of a number.  
This should work for both integers and real numbers.  
➡️ [Solution](../LAB-1/abs.oz)

### Exercise 2: Factorial (Recursive Function)  
Compute **n!**, where *n* is a natural number.  
➡️ [Solution](../LAB-1/fact.oz)

---

### Exercise 3: Power  
Compute $n^m$, where *n* is an integer and *m* is a natural number.  
➡️ [Solution](../LAB-1/pow.oz)

---

### Exercise 4: Fibonacci (Recursive Example)  
Compute $F_n$, where *n* is a natural number and $F_n$ is the *n*-th Fibonacci number.  
➡️ [Solution](../LAB-1/fibonacci.oz)

---

### Exercise 5: Maximum (Recursive)  
Compute the maximum of two natural numbers, knowing that the only allowed test with a conditional is the test whether a number is zero  
(that is, `if N==0 then … else … end`).
